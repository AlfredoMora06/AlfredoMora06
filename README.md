<h2 align="center">👋 ¡Hola, soy Alfredo!</h2>
<br/>
👨🏽‍💻 I'm a software developer from Oaxaca, México.
<br/>
<br/>
🚀 My journey began with at FDR HS, where I printed my first "Hello World" on C++.
<br/>
<br/>
🎓 I went to Hunter College where I learned coding fundamentals and graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science.
<br/>
<br/>
👷🏽 I joined <a href="https://www.tracfloapp.com">TracFlo</a> (a construction fintech startup) as an intern in 2021 and proceeded to become part of their team as a fullstack engineer. 
<br/>
<br/>
<h2 align="center">🛠️ Over the years, I've honed my skills in a variety of technologies</h2> 

React  
TypeScript  
Material-UI  
Bootstrap  
Node.js  
Javascript  
HTML  
CSS  
Postgres

🎯 My dream is to better my software engineering skills a bit each day and help out my community in the U.S and in Mexico, in any way I can. In my spare time, you can find me playing soccer, trying new food around Queens, or backpacking across Europe.

🌟 Let's connect! I'm open to networking, discussing exciting job opportunities, or just chatting about developments in the tech world
