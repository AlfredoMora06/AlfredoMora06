🚀 My journey began with at FDR HS, where I printed my first "Hello World" on C++.

🎓 I went to Hunter College where I learned coding fundamentals and graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science.

👷🏽 I joined TracFlo (a construction fintech startup) as an intern in 2021 and proceeded to become part of their team as a founding engineer. 

🎯 My dream is to better my software engineering skills a bit each day and help out my community in the U.S and in Mexico, in any way I can. In my spare time, you can find me playing soccer, trying new food around Queens, or backpacking across Europe.

🌟 Let's connect! I'm open to networking, discussing exciting job opportunities, or just chatting about developments in the tech world
